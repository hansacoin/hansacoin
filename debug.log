Error: To use hansad, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:
 /root/.hansa/hansa.conf
It is recommended you use the following random password:
rpcuser=hansarpc
rpcpassword=3zvmC7i7C6nEHbwRPS4SZzi2QAy9KQm1bJRK8PkR4NHa
(you do not need to remember this password)
The username and password MUST NOT be the same.
If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.
It is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;
for example: alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s "hansa Alert" admin@foo.com
